# Random Password Generator

## About The Project

This website was created to randomly generate a password for the user once they clicked the "Generate Password" button. The user is prompted with different messages asking how long they want their password to be and if they would like to include different character types in their password. These character types are Lower Case, Upper Case, Numbers, and Special characters. The user must choose to include at least one of these types or the password cannot be generated. Once the user chooses their criteria, the password is generated to include the character types they chose into a random order and the length of the password is however long the user chose in the beginning.

## Important!

Choosing a low length password and choosing all of the character types may result in the password not having all of the different types of characters in the password. For example: The user selects the password to be 8 characters long and wants to include Lower Case, Upper Case, Numbers, and Special characters. The password that generates may look like "f%pc7dek". Notice how the password does not have an Upper Case even though the user selected it to be apart of the criteria. Hit the button again until a password with all of the criteria is generated.
